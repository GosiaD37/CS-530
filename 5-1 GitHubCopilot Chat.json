I have never used Pygame before, so I need you to guide me through research and implementation.\n\nThe game must meet these requirements:\n? Built with Pygame only\n? Uses simple 2D graphics (circles, rectangles, etc.)\n? Includes keyboard controls to move a player object\n? Includes a challenge mechanic (enemy, obstacle, or timer)\n? Includes a scoring system visible on screen\n? Shows on-screen player instructions\n? Includes basic win or loss conditions\n? Game must be stable and playable\n\nPlease explain how Pygame works, then generate starter code that initializes a window and draws a player object. Add detailed comments. I will then ask you for improvements step-by-step."
